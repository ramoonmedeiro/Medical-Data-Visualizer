# Medical-Data-Visualizer

The idea of the project was to demonstrate skills for creating bar graphs using clustering methods, in addition to creating the heat map.

The script main.py and medical_data_visualizer.py show all the necessary code to clean data or data filtering and construct the two graphs below

The first graph (bar graph) shows the number of incidence of some body characteristics such as high cholesterol, overweight and etc for two groups of people, that is, people with heart problems and people without such problem. The idea of the project was not to explain what the following graphs are, but to demonstrate the skill with Python tools such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy and seaborn.
